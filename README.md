# Ticketpower on Rails

With Ticketpower, you can browse and purchase tickets to upcoming concerts. Anyone can view all upcoming concerts, but only a user can signin (or sign up) to view their account and tickets they have purchased. When finished, the user can log out to ensure their account is kept safe.
